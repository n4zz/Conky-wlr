# Conky-wlr

## Love Conky and want it to run natively on Wayland?  
You're in the right place!

I'm not a professional developer or programmer — my experience is limited to Bash, Python, and small personal projects. Still, I decided to start this project because I believe there's a need for Conky to work properly under Wayland.  

I understand this will be a long-term effort, and not everything may succeed. This project is **experimental** and open to everyone — anyone is welcome to join, help, test, or contribute ideas.

## Project Goal

The aim is to create a **Wayland-native backend for Conky**, allowing:

- Text, graphs, and circular indicators (Lua gauges)  
- Stable operation on modern compositors (Plasma, Sway, Hyprland)  
- Experiments and prototypes that anyone can try and extend  

---

## How to Contribute

1. The repository is open for contributors — any help is welcome.  
2. To add features or test, create an **issue** or a **pull request**.  
3. Communication takes place via GitHub issues or PR comments.

## Project Status

- This project is in its **early stages**  
- Currently serves mainly as a place for experiments and research  
- The goal is to gradually build a functional Wayland backend
