## Love Conky and want it to run natively on Wayland?  
You're in the right place!

## 🎯 What is this project?           
         
This repository is an **experimental attempt to build a native Wayland backend for Conky**.          
         
I’m **not a professional developer** — my experience comes mostly from small Bash, Python, HTML & CSS projects.           
But Conky deserves to run properly on Wayland without X11, XWayland, or hacks… so here we are.      
          
This project:        
- may take a long time,         
- may fail in some parts,         
- will definitely evolve,         
- and **anyone is welcome to join or experiment**.

## 🌟 Project Vision
- Build a **Wayland-native backend** for Conky         
- Support **text, graphs, and Lua-based widgets**           
- Provide **cross-compositor compatibility**          
- Encourage **community-driven experimentation and contributions**

## 🚀 Current Status
      
This repository currently serves as:      
- a **research sandbox**,        
- a learning space for Wayland + SHM + Cairo,        
- and a step-by-step progression toward a functional prototype.        
      
Milestones are updated manually as development progresses.       
          
| Milestone | Progress |      
|-----------|----------|        
| Project Foundation | 🔹 25% |       
| Wayland Architecture Research | 🔹 33% |        
| Prototype Rendering Layer | 🔹 33% |

## 📝 Contributing
  
It will be open to contributors once there is a functional basis.        
For now, it is being used for experimenting with Wayland.

## 🎯 Milestones Overview
1. **Project Foundation** – setup, documentation, roadmap  
2. **Wayland Architecture Research** – backend study, rendering options, Lua feasibility  
3. **Prototype Rendering Layer** – minimal Wayland surface, text and shape rendering, placeholder for widgets
     
---         
        
  ✅ First step completed: `hello_wayland.c` skeleton created and successfully tested.  
  This minimal Wayland client creates a surface and confirms the connection to the compositor.  
  [See file](https://github.com/n4zz/Conky-wlr/blob/main/Files/01.hello_wayland/hello_wayland.c)       
  
  ✅ SHM buffer allocation + drawing  
  [See file](https://github.com/n4zz/Conky-wlr/blob/main/Files/02.wayland_shm/wayland_shm.c)       
      
  ✅ Cairo-based text rendering      
  [See file](https://github.com/n4zz/Conky-wlr/blob/main/Files/03.wayland_shm_cairo/wayland_shm_cairo.c)      
           
  🔜 Modular rendering architecture (planned for step 04)
