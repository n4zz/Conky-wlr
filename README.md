# Conky-wlr

## Love Conky and want it to run natively on Wayland?  
You're in the right place!

I'm not a professional developer or programmer — my experience is limited to Bash, Python, and small personal projects. Still, I decided to start this project because I believe there's a need for Conky to work properly under Wayland.  

I understand this will be a long-term effort, and not everything may succeed. This project is **experimental** and open to everyone — anyone is welcome to join, help, test, or contribute ideas.

> **Wayland-native Conky** – bringing Conky-style system monitoring to Wayland compositors  
> (Plasma, Sway, Hyprland, etc.)

---

## 🌟 Project Vision
- Build a **Wayland-native backend** for Conky  
- Support **text, graphs, and Lua-based widgets**  
- Provide **cross-compositor compatibility**  
- Encourage **community-driven experimentation and contributions**

---

## 🚀 Current Status
- This project is in its **early stages**       
- Currently serves mainly as a place for experiments and research         
- The goal is to gradually build a functional Wayland backend
